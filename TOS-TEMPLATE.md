# Reverse Terms of Service — "You Own You" Template

*Any AI platform can adopt this template. It is open source under AGPL-3.0.*

## Terms of Service — [Platform Name]

**Effective Date:** [Date]

These Terms of Service establish a **fiduciary relationship** between [Platform Name] ("we," "us," "the Platform") and you ("the User"). Unlike traditional terms of service where the platform reserves broad rights over user data, these terms establish that **your data belongs to you** and we owe you a duty of care.

### 1. YOUR DATA IS YOURS

1.1. All data you create, generate, or store through the Platform ("Your Data") is your exclusive property.

1.2. Your Data includes but is not limited to: conversations, memories, preferences, behavioral patterns, documents, configurations, AI agent training data, and any knowledge derived from your interactions.

1.3. We do not own, license, sublicense, or claim any rights to Your Data. Ever.

1.4. We will never use Your Data to train AI models, improve our services, conduct research, or for any purpose other than providing the service to you.

### 2. WE CANNOT ACCESS YOUR DATA

2.1. Your Data is encrypted using keys that only you possess. We store ciphertext that we cannot decrypt.

2.2. We do not have, and have never had, the ability to read, copy, analyze, or process Your Data in its unencrypted form.

2.3. No employee, contractor, executive, board member, or automated system of the Platform has the ability to decrypt Your Data.

2.4. This is not a policy decision. This is an architectural guarantee enforced by cryptography. The source code implementing this guarantee is publicly available at [Repository URL].

### 3. FIDUCIARY DUTY

3.1. We owe you a fiduciary duty with respect to Your Data. This means we must act in your best interest regarding the handling, storage, and protection of Your Data.

3.2. This fiduciary duty takes precedence over the interests of our shareholders, investors, acquirers, or any third party.

3.3. In any conflict between our commercial interests and your data rights, your data rights prevail.

### 4. DATA PORTABILITY

4.1. You may export all of Your Data at any time, in a standard, machine-readable format.

4.2. We will never restrict, delay, degrade, or charge for data export.

4.3. Your exported data includes all AI agent configurations, learned preferences, institutional memory, and interaction history.

### 5. SURVIVAL

5.1. Your rights under these Terms survive:
  - Termination of your account (voluntary or involuntary)
  - Bankruptcy or dissolution of the Platform
  - Acquisition of the Platform by any third party
  - Any court order, subpoena, or governmental demand

5.2. In the event of acquisition, the acquiring entity inherits these fiduciary obligations in full. These Terms cannot be modified, waived, or superseded by an acquisition agreement.

5.3. In the event of bankruptcy, Your Data must be returned to you or destroyed. It cannot be sold, transferred, or included as an asset in any proceedings.

### 6. TRANSPARENCY

6.1. The cryptographic systems protecting Your Data are open source. You may audit them at any time.

6.2. We will publish a transparency report annually disclosing:
  - The number of government data requests received
  - The number of requests we were able to comply with (expected: zero, as we cannot decrypt Your Data)
  - Any changes to our infrastructure or architecture

6.3. Any material changes to these Terms require 90 days advance notice and your affirmative consent.

### 7. NO EXCEPTIONS

7.1. There are no exceptions to the above. No "national security" exception. No "fraud prevention" exception. No "improving our services" exception.

7.2. If a law or regulation would require us to compromise these guarantees, we will challenge it legally, relocate our infrastructure, or shut down the Platform rather than comply.

7.3. We mean this.

### 8. VERIFICATION

8.1. These Terms are backed by open-source code available at [Repository URL].

8.2. You do not need to take our word for any of the above. You can verify it yourself.
